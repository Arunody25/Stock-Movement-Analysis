**Sentiment Analysis and Stock Movement Prediction**
This project investigates the relationship between sentiment scores derived from textual data and stock price movements (rise or fall). It utilizes machine learning and data visualization techniques to analyze and predict stock price trends based on sentiment analysis.

Features
Sentiment Analysis: Calculates sentiment scores from textual data (e.g., news headlines, social media posts).
Stock Movement Prediction: Classifies stock price movement as 0 (Fall) or 1 (Rise) based on sentiment scores.
Data Visualization: Includes scatter plots and other visualizations to depict relationships between sentiment and stock movement.
Machine Learning Integration: Employs classification models to assess and improve predictive accuracy.
